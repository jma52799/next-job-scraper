        "description": "About GameChanger:  We believe in the life-changing impact youth sports have on and off the field because they encourage leadership, teamwork, responsibility, and confidence—important life lessons that have the power to propel our youth toward meaningful futures. We recognize that without coaches, parents, and volunteers, organized youth sports could not exist. By building the first and best place to experience the youth sports moments important to our community, we are helping families elevate the next generation through youth sports.  So if you love sports and their community-building potential, or building cool products is your sport, GameChanger is the team for you. We are a remote-first, dynamic tech company based in New York City, and we are solving some of the biggest challenges in youth sports today.     The Position:  GameChanger users already live stream and watch millions of hours of youth sporting events and clips using the GameChanger app, and we’re looking for a fully-remote Senior Software Engineer to help lead the expansion of our video capabilities. You will be part of the newly formed video team which owns our video pipeline end to end, evolves our live streaming and post-game video capabilities for users, simplifies the developer experience for product teams that integrate video into our apps, and ensures we have a scalable and resilient platform to handle millions of streams and hundreds of millions of highlight clips annually.  As Senior Software Engineer, you’ll be a hands on engineer helping the team to build and support our video platform. As a member of the team you are expected to have strong communication skills and collaborate within our team and other platform and product teams to design and build video-related projects that advance our streaming capabilities, handle our increasing scale, and improve our users’ experience with video to ensure that fans can always capture and watch the moments that matter to them most. As a member of this team, you’ll give input into decisions that impact the entire video stack: mobile broadcast and playback frameworks, back-end ingest/transcoding/playback infrastructure, VoD storage and playback, and hooks for other workflows such as automatic highlight clipping, advertising, live-stream overlays, and AI/Computer Vision workflows.  Check out some of our current video capabilities at https://gc.com/live-video     What You’ll Do:     Working in your cross-functional team of mobile, web, back-end, and infrastructure engineers, you’ll help to design, implement/code, and support video features across the video pipeline stack, including live video ingestion, transcoding, integration, storage, and playback/consumption at scale.   Work on our backend video platform (currently written in typescript) providing APIs for other teams to build customer experiences from.   Collaborate with other members of the team and other teams including: mobile, web, machine learning/computer vision, and platform teams on multi-faceted projects across the entire video processing system to drive improved user experiences and business outcomes.   Review and provide feedback on designs and code/PRs.   Help build internal SDKs, frameworks, and tooling to enable product development teams to easily integrate video into the product at various stages of the video pipeline.   Help define and build real-time monitoring and measurement systems for critical operational workflows in the video pipeline, including tools for on-call developers and customer support to manage and troubleshoot issues. Support the video workflows through an occasional (few days per month) on-call rotation with a team of other engineers.   Help interview and onboard other software engineers in the video and live-streaming space.       What You’ll Bring:     Background in video and audio streaming, preferably with a focus on live-streaming of user-generated content.   Understanding of the basics of audio and video packaging principles, codecs, and other associated technologies and tools, including their relative tradeoffs, such as MPEG Video, MPEG-2 TS, HLS, DASH, H.264 AVC/H.265 HEVC/VP9/AV1/VVC, RTMP/enhanced RTMP/SRT, FFMPEG, DRM, etc.   Hands-on software development experience designing and building live and VOD streaming workflows and exposure to video technologies around mobile broadcast, ingest, transcoding, storage, playback, and related systems at scale.   Experience coding in at least one of the languages commonly used in the video space, such as Python/Go/C++/Rust, as well as experience in other higher-level languages such as Node/Typescript, React, or mobile languages like Kotlin or Swift.   Familiarity with mobile video broadcasting of user-generated content and the challenges of optimizing streaming quality and reliability across a variety of devices and network conditions.   Hands-on experience with one or more video players.   Experience designing/building APIs for a backend system.   Front end development experience in web, iOS (Swift), and/or Android (Kotlin) is a plus but not required.   Experience building and supporting scalable and high-performance video pipelines in cloud environments is a huge plus. We use AWS but any cloud/container experience is fine.       Who You Are:     An excellent communicator and writer capable of breaking down projects and technical details for stakeholders of varying expertise.   Comfortable working across multiple technologies, programming languages, and areas of the video stack.   Able to effectively collaborate within your own and other technical teams.   Someone who has a passion for learning the latest tech in the mobile and live streaming spaces.       Perks:     Work remotely throughout the US* or from our well-furnished, modern office in Manhattan, NY.   Unlimited vacation policy.   Paid volunteer opportunities.
